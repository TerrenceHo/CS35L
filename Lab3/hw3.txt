Q1:  It was not necessary to remove that line, because it is a case condition
that falls through to the next line with the exact same case.  It was only an
attempt to clean up messy code to be more maintainable.

Q2: The UNIX version caters to English speaking users rather than international
users.  This format has written months which may not be understandable 
to those that do not speak English, such as international workers.
Additionally, this implementation may cause bugs later down in the road due to
incompatibility with the main source tree of the coreutils, which may make
updating harder.  

Q3: /dev/null is an empty file for developers to dump their output into if they
do not want it.  The program expects the file to have some text data inside, but
if there isn't any then an index out of range error is raised, because there is
no input.  
Traceback (most recent call last):

IndexError: list index out of range

Q4: A syntax error is raised.  Exceptions in Python were iterable and
implemented as a tuple.  In Python2, you could deference this list and unpack it
into it's different variables, but Python3 remove this ability.  This is known
as tuple unpacking.  

  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

To fix this, you would need something like this:

except IOError as e:
    errno, strerror = e.args
