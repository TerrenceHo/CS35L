robbie@10.97.85.182
terrence@10.97.85.173

I logged onto my BeagleBone by using 
ssh root@192.168.7.2

First we needed to connect our BeagleBone to the specified wifi,
CR3760-Wifi. 
sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1065020_4352333736302d77696669_managed_ps
connmanctl> Passphrase? <Insert Password>
connmanctl> quit

Once I logged onto my BeagleBone chip, I set up a user directory
for my partner under /home/robbie.  
sudo useradd -d /home/robbie -m robbie
sudo passwd robbie

I then gave him permissions into the .ssh directory
cd /home/robbie
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R robbie .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

On my own BeagleBone, I created a public/private key pair to be able
to put my public key onto my partner's BeagleBone server and then ssh
into the server without having to use a password. We use ssh-copy-id
to place my public key onto my partner's BeagleBone. 
We use ssh-agent to
add the private key to the authentiation process.
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i terrence@10.97.85.173

We use ssh-agent to manage authentication, so we do not have to type the
password we set earlier to ssh into out partner's BeagleBone.
eval "$(ssh-agent)"
ssh-add
ssh terrence@10.97.85.173

Once on the server, I ran a couple commands to confirm that I was
on my partner's BeagleBone.  For example, the home directory that
he set up for me was /home/terrence.  Thus I ran pwd to confirm this.
pwd
/home/terrence

I am in the directory that he set up for me. Additionally, I ran the firefox
command.

firefox
(firefox-esr:1465): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.
	Using the fallback 'C' locale.
Error: GDK_BACKEND does not match available displays

Firefox didn't work because it requires a graphical component that
was not installed. But we did verify that I was on my partner's 
BeagleBone
