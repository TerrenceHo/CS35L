1.
Use man -k "<Insert String Here>" to search for manuals with this string

2.
I used the command which to determine where where cp and wc were located
cp is located at /usr/local/cs/bin/cp
wc is located at /usr/local/cs/bin/wc
There is also a version of cp and wc located in /usr/local/bin, but that version
is not used on the Linux Server because /usr/local/cs/bin appears before
/usr/local/bin in the PATH.

3. We know that executables are stored under /usr/bin.  We can use 
ls -l /usr/bin/? which will show you all permissions of files that have one
letter only.  The output is

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 41496 Jun 30  2016 '['
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 19904 Jun  1 04:10  w
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     4 Sep 15 16:39  X -> Xorg

We can see that the X executable is a symbolic link to another executable Xorg.
The command '[' is a builtin bash command that evaluates conditional
expressions, a synonym for the "test" builtin.
The command 'w' is an executable that shows who is logged on and who what they
are doing, as per the man page for w. 

4. By running the commands ls -l /usr/bin/emacs we see that the emacs command is
really just a symlink to /etc/alternatives/emacs.

5. g represents the group, and s allows you to set the user or group ID on
execution. Thus, chmod g+s allows you set it so that the file is executed by the
group that owns it, granting permissions to the whole group.

6. Use the command find -ctime -21 to find all files that were modified within
the last 21 days.  I used the man page to search for references of time, until I
saw that -ctime allowed you to use find files that were modified n * 24 hours
ago.

7. I used the command find / -type d -ctime 21 to find all directories that were
modified in the last 3 weeks

8. We found 293 symbolic links in the repository where find is located. We found
find using the command which find.  We counted the number of symbolic links
using ls -l | grep ^l | wc -l, which takes in all the input from long list
format, passes through a grep command that finds all lines that start with l,
and counts the number of lines that start with l.  This works because all
symbolic links start with l.

9. The oldest file is libgpg-error.so.0.10.0.  We found this by running the
command ls -lt, which sorts long form output by time it was modified.  Any file
with a - is a regular file, so we can just look at the last - file, which should
be the oldest file.

10. locale displays current locale settings based on environment variables that
control the locale, which are set according to locale(7), IEEE's standard
variables for controlling locale.

11. We can use the command C-h and then press a to to find commands that have
the associated word with them, in this case "sort".  We found these commands
that have the word "sort"

Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort 

12.
C-M-a beginning-of-defun: Move backwards to beginning of defun
C-M-b backward-sexp: Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M-c exit-recursive-edit: Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
C-M-d down-list: Move forward down one level of parentheses.
C-M-e end-of-defun: Move forward to next end of defun.
C-M-f forward-sexp: Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M-h mark-defun: Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.

13.
The keybinding C-g signals a quit, and stops execution of a Lisp function when
it is signaled.  We find the quit by using C-h-b to bring up a buffer of
keybinding details, C-x o to switch to that buffer and use C-s to search for the
command.

14. 
The yank function in emcas pastes the last bit of text that was killed
within emacs.  Found by using C-h b and search for "yank".

15. By default, the emacs command also lists the parent and current directory
details.  ls -l highlights executables in green and aliases in blue.  Emacs'
dired command only lists aliases in blue.
