2. Command Testing
tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html
This command outputs anything that is a letter, and replaces everything with a
newline character.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html
This also outputs anything that is a letter and replaces everything with a
newline character, but it squeezes all the repeating newlines into one, 
removing all excess space.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort
This sorts the previous output alphabetically by word.  Words are still 
repeated.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u
The output is still sorted, but each word is unique and only appears once.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | comm - words
This command reads in the sorted unique words of the webpage and compares it to
the words file.  The first column outputs lines unique to the webpage.  The
second column outputs lines unique to the second column.  The last column
outputs words that are common to both files.

3. Buildwords Script
#!/bin/bash
# Grep for all table entries using <td>. Reads input from stdin.
grep '<td>.\{1,\}<\/td>' |

# Select every other line using sed
sed -n '1~2!p' |

# Replcae all uppercase to lowercase
tr "A-Z" "a-z" |

# Replace all ` with '
tr "\`" "\'" |

# Replace <td> with nothing.  Do the same for all html tags
sed 's/<td>//g' |
sed 's/<\/td>//g' |
sed 's/<u>//g' |
sed 's/<\/u>//g' |

# # Remove all leading spaces
sed 's/^\s*//g' |

# # Remove all commas and replace spaces with a new line
sed 's/,//g' |
sed 's/\s/\n/g' |

# # remove anything that is not a Hawaiian letter
sed '/-/d' |
tr -cd "pk\'mnwlhaeiou\n" |

# sort input and make unique
sort -u |
sed '/^$/d'

exit 0
