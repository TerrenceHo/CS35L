First, we checkout v3.0 in a new branch called v3.0
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

We apply a quote-3.0-patch.txt using patch
patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

I used emacs to open up Changelog (C-x 4 a) and then write my git commit message
inside the change log for each file.
emacs src/filename.c
...

We commit using this change log and format a patch
git add .
git commit -F Changelog
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

We then download my partner's patch onto my computer and create a new branch to
apply his patch.
git checkout v3.0 -b partner

            maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", `like this'

            This is a backported change for corutils v3.0 for quoting
            'like this' or "like this", instead of `like this' or
            ``like this''.
            * src/cmp.c src/diff.c src/diff3.c:
            * src/dir.c src/sdiff.c src/util.c:
            Quote 'like this' in output.

The log shows that his patch was applied onto our branch
We run the same steps as in the lab to configure and run the diffutils
./bootstrap
patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check
make distdir

This created a directory diffutils-3.0.1-5dec, which had my partner's Changelog,
which was the same as the log above.  As such, using my partner's patch was
successful.

This next section concerns using gitk:
I download XQuartz for Mac, and use it to log onto SSH.  This allows me to use
gitk on the Linux server and stream back visuals.
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git gitrepo
cd gitrepo
gitk

Using the UI, we locate the latest merge point now later than 2015:
